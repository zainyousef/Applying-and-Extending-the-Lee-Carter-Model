# Applying and Extending the Lee-Carter model
This was a project I completed during my university studies in 2021! Uploading here so I don't forget/ lose it lol

I have uploaded:
- The code I used to generate the report (this is a R Markdown file) - this may be the biggest script I've ever made lol (mainly because of all the words), this won't run as haven't uploaded the data set for it.
- The report itself
- A presentation I created with dictation! - open up in PowerPoint & hit "Slideshow > Play from Start".

Feel free to ask any questions on it / steal any code!
